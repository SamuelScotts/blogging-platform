# Blogging-platform
Building a fullstack blogging platform, from scratch, using MongoDB, Express, Vue.js and Node.js.

Currently, MongoDB has not yet been added. As such, all data is being initialised, got from, and stored within, in an array of objects.  This array is held within '.server/server.js'.

There has been very little design work done to the project.  As such, it's not very asthetically pleasing.  Simply there to get the functionality correct, which is still a work in progress.

User authentication/login is something that could/will likely be added in the future.

Feel free to use the code, however as always, I will not be held liable for any use by others.
